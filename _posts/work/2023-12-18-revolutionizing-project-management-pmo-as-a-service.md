## Introduction

During the second half of 2023, I developed a PMO as a service concept to deliver a bespoke Project Management Office (PMO) service for a resources company. This service concept was a speculative design aimed at strengthening a bid to secure a contract for ICT service design services.

## Context

### Client Background

The resources company faced numerous challenges in managing their projects effectively. These challenges included inconsistent project management practices, lack of standardized processes, and difficulties in tracking project progress and performance. Understanding the company's need for a robust PMO solution in the mining and metals industry, I crafted a speculative service design in response to their request for proposal (RFP), positioning us as the ideal partner for their PMO needs.

### Speculative Design for Bid Success

Crafting speculative user personas, outlining user journeys, and developing a comprehensive service blueprint, I showcased our capabilities in ICT service design to align with the resources company's unique requirements.

## Service Design and Blueprint

### Customer Personas

I meticulously identified key stakeholders within the resources company, ensuring our service design addressed their unique needs and pain points. In particular, I worked from my experience in the mining industry and my understanding of the roles and challenges in mining project delivery. This included addressing the needs of project managers, executives, and operational teams.

### User Journeys

Outlining user journeys, I detailed the anticipated interactions of the resources company's teams with the proposed PMO service, shaping a solution that seamlessly integrated with their existing workflows. These user journeys encompassed the entire project lifecycle, from initiation to closure, and highlighted how the PMO service would support and enhance each stage.

### Service Blueprints

Developing a comprehensive service blueprint, I illustrated the end-to-end process of PMO service delivery, providing a visual guide for both our team and the client. The service blueprint detailed the front-stage and back-stage activities, as well as the supporting processes and systems required to deliver a high-quality PMO service.

## Implementation

### Agile Methodology

I implemented an agile approach, allowing for continuous improvement based on client feedback during iterative cycles of the PMO service delivery. This agile methodology enabled us to adapt quickly to changing requirements and ensure that the PMO service remained aligned with the resources company's evolving needs. Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives were conducted to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

### User Acceptance Criteria

Defining clear user acceptance criteria, I provided the resources company with measurable benchmarks to evaluate the success of the PMO service. These criteria included metrics such as project delivery timelines, budget adherence, and stakeholder satisfaction. By establishing these criteria upfront, we ensured that the PMO service was delivering tangible value to the client.

## Results

### Successful Bid and Contract Award

Our speculative design played a pivotal role in winning the contract, showcasing our understanding of the resources company's needs and our capability to deliver tailored solutions. The client recognized the value of our proposed PMO service and its potential to address their project management challenges.

One significant lesson learned was the importance of regularly engaging with stakeholders throughout the service design and implementation process to ensure their needs were being met. Additionally, the agile methodology proved to be highly effective in delivering a flexible and responsive PMO service.
