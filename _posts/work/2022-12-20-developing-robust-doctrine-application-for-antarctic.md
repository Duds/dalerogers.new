excerpt: "The Australian Antarctic Division was struggling with inconsistent doctrine and operating procedures. I created a plan to make doctrine digital based on better worldwide practices to support expeditioners to stay safe in the Antarctic."

An Australian government agency was committed to a high-risk deep-field inland traverse activity in the southern summer of 2022-23 to establish an Inland Station as part of the Million-Year Ice Core Project. I was asked to perform a digital doctrine scoping study to develop a procurement/development plan to deploy digital doctrine and standard operating procedures. The platform required validation and a closed-loop feedback mechanism to support evidence-based decision-making.

## The Challenge

Doctrine and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in the agency were challenging to access, inconsistent, distributed without version control and developed and delivered using manual means. This caused challenges for agency staff and partners to develop new procedures and policies, which were validated internally before release to the agency's workforce.

The agency was in the process of developing standard operating guidelines for traverse activity. Due to the nature of the work and the inherent risks, the agency required a digital platform to assist in developing and delivering these procedures and policies. The platform needed to function in Delayed/Disconnected, Intermittently-Connected, Low-Bandwidth (DIL) conditions in remote locations with intermittent telecommunication and poor power availability. In addition, the agency required the digital platform to comply with the Australian Federal Government Digital Service Standards and the Digital Transformation Agency's Digital Service Standards.

The agency sought out my support to provide an environmental scan and scoping study that would enable the development of a strategy to utilise a digital platform as a knowledge management tool.

## The Outcome

![Wireframe of digital doctrine platform](/images/case-studies/doctrine-platform-wireframe.jpg)

I performed an environment scan and scoping study of digital doctrine platform options to deliver a strategy to develop a digital doctrine pilot in 2022-23 to provide the agency with digital standard operating procedures to improve SOP accessibility, maintain version control and eliminate paperwork. I provided the scoping documentation, which the agency is using to develop its internal digital doctrine pilot in 2022-23 that will provide a closed-loop feedback mechanism to support evidence-based decision-making.

The digital doctrine platform is being developed by the agency using the designs, diagrams, user stories and wireframes I delivered during the scoping study. The digital doctrine platform will support developing and delivering standard operating procedures and policies to the agency's workforce. This digital platform will provide standardised formats that are easy to follow in disconnected and intermittent conditions.
