I was engaged in designing and delivering a verification service application for an Australian government agency. This new service was developed to drive continuous improvement and quality-improved outcomes in field inspections. The agency will use it to support national security activities, including trade and border control, sovereign risk and incident management.

The service design included the development of a service model and delivery approach, business requirements and a service implementation roadmap. The work provides a comprehensive, dynamic, scalable, and secure verification platform.

The recommendations in these service designs provide a sustainable, future-proofed, scalable architecture for verification for the agency, including sovereign security stakeholders, service providers, quarantine agents and security inspectors. The recommendations enabled the agency to rapidly deliver services to its clients and stakeholders through an agile development approach, with agreed services delivered by a development partner.

The recommendations in this project have moved into the project delivery contract established with the agency's preferred application developer. I have continued to support the agency with Product Owner services during the platform development phase. The project was completed and put into production in December 2022. It is built on Dynamics 365 with Azure cognitive services and a PowerApps canvas field tool to support inspectors performing their verification activities. The agency accepted an integration contract for ongoing service management support.
